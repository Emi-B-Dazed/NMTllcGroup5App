		Watershed LLC research will focus on water management,
		conservation, and the environmental processes associated
		with rainfall such as soil erosion, flood generation,
		and vegetation community establishment. Students will
		install advanced instrumentation for watershed monitoring,
		conduct experiments to test soil and water conservation
		practices, and evaluate plans for both urban and rural
		storm-water management. Students will combine extensive
		fieldwork, data management and visualization, and
		statistical analyses to gain insight into processes that
		control water availability and our society's ability to
		exist in a rapidly changing semi-arid environment.</p>
