		<p>My name is Alexander Kral. I am pursuing a bachelor’s degree in both Electrical Engineering and Mathematics. I was born in Albuquerque New Mexico where I lived until coming down south to Socorro. This here is my second semester at New Mexico Tech, where I hope to graduate in three and a half years’ time. If I had one piece of advice for succeeding here at Tech it would be to surround yourself with people who motivate and challenge you to be your best. It’s too easy to accept failure because your peers share in that failure.</p>

		<p>My name is Tyler Mobraten and I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area. This is my second year studying Mechanical and Electrical Engineering at New Mexico Tech. Over the last year I have picked up an interest in mining and geology. I spend my free time working on my Land Rover, camping outdoors, and exploring historic and wilderness areas. When I graduate, I hope to work for a company such as Tesla, designing the cars of the future.</p>

		<h2>Aero Space</h2>
		<img src="http://infohost.nmt.edu/~engage/media/images/people/justinfan.jpg" width="150" height="150">
		<p>My name is Justin Fan, a senior majoring in Mechanical Engineering. My primary interests in studying ME are now oriented towards Aerospace. I worked with the SAE Aero team to build a blended wing body aircraft which is how I realized I wanted to become involved in Aerospace. I enjoy swimming, playing ultimate frisbee, basketball, and volleyball in my spare time. Apart from playing sports, I enjoy hiking and camping. My tip for success is don’t be afraid to ask questions and get involved with anything. Make friends with people from sports clubs or volunteer with design teams.</p>

		<p>Hello! I’m Riley Myers, a sophomore computer science and electrical engineering double-major. I’m a learning coach with the Gear Systems LLC. I’ve helped out hosting (and competed in) Game Jam, a friendly competition to construct videogames – in 48 hours. My current interest in computer science is security, and how to break thing in ways you want. I love hiking, reading, music, an innumerable list of odd things, and fencing. If you have any questions about computer science or math, I can help!</p>

		My name’s Elijah and I’m a third year Mechanical engineering student. My interests include playing and listening to music and working on or talking about cars and motorcycles. The ides that I can help the most with are math ides (Calculus and ODEs), statics/mechanics, and general chemistry and physics. If you need any help with those ides, other Mechanical engineering ides or you just need some motivation, I’ll do my best to help!

		Hi, my name is Troy Pacheco. I am a sophomore here at Tech in the Mechanical Engineering department. Last year I was in the Aerospace LLC and had an amazing experience. I am from Santa Fe and I went to St. Michael’s high school. At St. Mike’s I loved running cross country for all six years (my PR was 16:31). I was also on the chess team and astronomy club. In my free time I also enjoy playing piano and guitar. I love listening to rock and metal when I do all homework we have here at tech.

		<p>
		My name is Kaleigh Anderson. I enjoy coding but my real passion is working in the laboratory, meaning my major is Materials Engineering instead of Computer Science. I learned HTML in a high school id on Web Design where I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, and experimented slightly with Canvas. I have a flair for visual design and I will not finish a project until the colors are just right. I don’t have formal mentoring training but I am always eager to help.

		Hi! My name is Geoffrey Knox and I am a sophomore of Computer Science here at NMT. I was in the Mobile Computing LLC last semester where my partner and I used phonegap to create a few different rough apps of our own. I am now the Webmaster for the OSL, Advising, and LLC websites as well as a Learning Coach for Mobile Computing. I enjoy school, playing games, drawing, and working more and trying new things on my own project apps.

		<h2>Nanotechnology</h2>
		<img src="http://infohost.nmt.edu/~engage/media/images/people/jacobschirer.jpg" width="150" height="150">
		<p>
		I chose a career in mechanical engineering so as to find solutions from the base sciences, not with money and not with politics. My initiation into science was in my freshman year of high school where I attended two international science fairs. Since then I've enjoyed pursuing different research interests ranging from the raw sciences to constructive engineering applications. I've spent the summer digging on ancient ruins and I've spent the summer developing future engineering applications.

		<p>
		My name is John Paul Norman. I am a senior Mechanical Engineering major pursuing my minor in Management. I plan to go to graduate school after obtaining a bachelor’s degree and someday hope to work in project management. Aside from engineering I have a passion for acting, and theater. I enjoy spending my weekends in Socorro exploring and hiking in the area. I am a huge Carolina Panther fan and can be found in Fidel on Sunday’s over-passionately cheering for my team.

		<p>
		I’m a physics and electrical engineering double major with sides of optics, math, and atmospheric and astrophysics. I’ve been recruited to assist with the Space Vehicles LLC in the EE department this semester. I may be occasionally found outside Workman running my dog, skiing, clowning around with VR, or grousing about the necessity of sleep. I’m aspiring to head for grad school in computational quantum information, plasma, or astrophysics. In my copious free time, I’m working to develop data visualization applications for use with the HTC Vive.		</p>

		Hello everyone! I am currently a sophomore studying Technical Communications. So yes, that means I actually like writing. It is a privilege to be part of the Techpreneurs LLC and help arriving Techies adjust to the atmosphere. I enjoy helping others with writing, specifically the grammatical aspects. When I am not writing I can be found playing volleyball or drawing.		</p>
