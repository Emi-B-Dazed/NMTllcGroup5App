		Aerospace LLC research is designed to introduce freshman
		Mechanical Engineering majors to the basics of aerodynamics,
		engineering principles, research, design, and experimental
		testing. During the Fall 2014 semester, students will
		research and design different nose cones for a basic
		sounding rocket. They will bring their designs to life using
		the Engineering Design Lab's 3D printer. In the spring
		semester, the students will be creating avionics bays for
		the rockets and developing MATLAB code to predict the
		flight path of the rocket. Students will test their designs
		through a variety of laboratory experiments, including using
		a low-speed wind tunnel to calculate drag of the nose cones.
		The final project for the year will be to launch a rocket
		with the student-designed nose cone and instrumentation
		package and compare the flight data to predictions from the
		student-written MATLAB code. The Aerospace LLC research
		opportunity will introduce these first-year students to the
		variety of rocket and aerospace opportunities at New Mexico
		Tech, including the Aerospace Engineering minor.</p>
