		Robotics LLC research will provide a basic introduction to
		robotics and will contain both laboratory and lecture
		components. Over the semester, students will learn basic
		computer programming concepts, work with a variety of
		sensors and actuators, and design and build mechanical
		components. We will be using the Arduino microcontroller and
		by the end of the semester, students and their teams will
		compete in a robotics challenge. No prior experience with
		programming is required.</p>
