This is an application made by 3 freshmen Computer Science students who had
never developed any sort of application before. It was made at New Mexico
Institute of Mining and Technology under the Living Learning Community Porgram.
This Program was meant to give us a simple introduction to Application 
Development. It was originally made to be processed by PhoneGap, however the 
Web Browser still appears to work for the most part. Enter the app and enter
