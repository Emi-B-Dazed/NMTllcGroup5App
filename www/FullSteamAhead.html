		Full STEAM Ahead, or STEAM, is the most recent addition to the NMT
		Living Learning Community program. Students in the STEAM LLC will
		have hands on experience with humanities classes, working with their
		faculty to explore the history of modern science and technology!
		The associated lab courses will provide students with the ability
		to apply math, science, and engineering concepts to the information
		they have covered in the lectures. The LLC will fulfill a social
		science credit, which will help further a student on their path to
		graduation.</p>
