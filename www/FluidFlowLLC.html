		In Fluid Dynamics, the basic principles include how fluids
		flow in different ways, what causes drag, and how fluids
		conserve their volume and energy as they flow. We will focus
		on aspects of the flow over bodies immersed in a fluid.
		Projects on fluid flow models will include the flow of water
		around submarines, torpedo, and fish to optimize the designs
		of objects and/or fluid properties to reduce the drag. By
		correctly designing ships and submarines, it will be possible
		to greatly decrease the fuel consumption and improve the
		handling characteristics of the vessels.</p>
