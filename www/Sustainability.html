		Sustainability LLC research focuses on energy: assessing
		how much we use on campus, understanding how weather and
		climate affect consumption and supply, and utilizing technology
		to harness alternative energy sources. The research project
		for Sustainability is two-fold: 1) examining energy use on
		the NMT campus and 2) designing and implementing technology
		for using alternative energy. Research has included sensor
		deployment to find the critical areas of energy loss for
		buildings on campus, designing and building solar panel and
		wind turbine arrays, and launching weather balloons to study
		wind and solar potential for campus.</p>
