		research. Students will learn basic geology, how to apply
		the scientific method to the interpretation of geologic
		features, and will participate in individual and group
		research projects using data they collect. There will be
		numerous field trips, including trips to the local mountains
		and White Sands National Monument. Students must have basic
		camping gear and must be capable of moderately strenuous
		hiking on uneven ground.</p>
